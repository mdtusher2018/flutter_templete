# 🚀 Flutter Template – Clean Architecture & Scalable App Boilerplate

A production-ready **Flutter project template** built with **Clean Architecture**, **SOLID Principles**, and **Feature-Driven Development**. This template is scalable, maintainable, and ideal for medium to large applications.

---

## 🎉 Template Attribution & Clarification

This template is heavily based on the incredible work done by **[Momshad Dinury](https://github.com/momshaddinury/)**. I used his **Flutter template** as a starting point and made custom modifications to suit my personal development needs.

**Important Clarification:**  
While I have made several changes and created this version for my personal use, I want to make it clear that the original architecture and structure are inspired by **Momshad Dinury's** template.

I keep this template public on my personal GitHub account solely for easier access across multiple devices and accounts. This is **not** an attempt to claim credit for someone else’s work, but to maintain a personal, public copy that I can use wherever I need it.

For the original template, please refer to the [Momshad Dinury Flutter Template](https://github.com/momshaddinury/flutter_template).

### Why I’m Sharing This:
- **I value transparency**: I want to make sure I’m not taking credit for someone else's hard work.
- **For personal use**: This template is adapted to meet my needs but is based on the original template's architecture.

Thank you to **Momshad Dinury** for creating such a well-thought-out and structured template that has helped me accelerate my development!

* SOLID principles applied across layers
* Feature-driven folder structure
* Centralized API client with interceptor-based session refresh
* Global error handling & crash logging
* Automatic 401 unauthorized logout
* Strict separation of concerns (UI ↔ Logic ↔ Repository ↔ Models)

### 💻 State Management & Routing

| Library                | Usage                                            |

**Why feature-based?**
✔ Independent development per feature
✔ Highly scalable & maintainable
✔ Better code isolation
✔ Cleaner version control

## 🧩 Protobuf Module

Used as a learning & performance demo.

Best used for:

* Large APIs where response size matters
* Low-bandwidth communication
* Faster serialization than JSON

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Run code generators

```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Step 3: Launch the app

```
flutter run
```

---

## 🧰 Build Variants

### Debug Mode

* Logging enabled
* Error trace enabled
* Hot reload supported

### Release Mode

* Logging disabled
* Crashlytics enabled
* Performance optimized
